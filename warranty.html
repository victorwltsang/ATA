  <tr>
    <td class = "word">As with any outdoor product, proper care is essential for maintaining the high luster and corrosion properties of stainless steel. The stainless steel we useT-304 grade. This is one of the most durable metals produced for outdoor use. Nature, however, can and will fade or tarnish the appearance of any polished finish. In rare cases, the appearance of rust can form on the polished finish. The “surface rust” as it’s called, is simply elements found in nature that oxidizes on our finish. We recommend regular cleaning with soap and water. The use of a regular car wax applied every three months will normally provide a slick, protective barrier that will not allow the oxidizing elements to rest upon our products. We strongly recommend these preventative measures to allow you to enjoy our products for years.</td>
