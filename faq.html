Chrome nerf bars are dipped into a chemical bath hopefully without impurities and then dried. Stainless steel does not peel, ever. Many customers think our products are chrome because of the high lustrous shine! </td>

Many other brands may use cheaper, different grades of stainless claiming that it will last the life of your vehicle. But in many cases these bars will start to rust only after 8 or 9 short months.</td>
